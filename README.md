# House_Price_Prediction
Abstract:

This project focuses on developing a Real Estate Price Prediction Website using a combination of Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to predict house prices in Bangalore using a machine learning model built with scikit-learn and linear regression.

The project involves several key steps. First, the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle is cleaned and preprocessed, including outlier detection and removal, as well as feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance. Next, a machine learning model is developed using scikit-learn, with hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV. Model evaluation is conducted using K-fold cross-validation.

In addition to the machine learning model, a Python Flask server is developed to handle backend functionalities, while the frontend is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the prediction system. Overall, this project demonstrates the application of various technologies to create a comprehensive real estate price prediction system.
